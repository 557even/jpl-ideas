Relationship between Dark Matter, Electromagnetic Fields and the Schwarzschild Radius

Introduction

The dark matter problem arises because the observed motions of galaxies and gravitational lensing cannot be explained by visible matter alone.  Observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing and cosmic microwave background anisotropies imply that roughly 27 % of the universe’s mass–energy density consists of dark matter ￼ ￼.  Dark matter does not emit or absorb radiation and is therefore invisible.  Its presence is inferred only through its gravitational effects ￼.  Understanding how dark matter interacts (or fails to interact) with electromagnetic (EM) fields and how it behaves near a Schwarzschild black hole helps researchers test dark‑matter models and design experiments to detect it.

Dark matter and electromagnetic fields

Lack of electromagnetic interactions
	•	Neutrality and darkness:  Observations and laboratory searches show that dark‑matter particles are electrically neutral and do not interact with the electromagnetic force.  CERN notes that unlike normal matter, dark matter does not absorb, reflect or emit light ￼.  NASA echoes this, explaining that dark matter interacts with ordinary matter through gravity but does not interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, so it doesn’t absorb, reflect or emit any light ￼.  Because of this, dark matter cannot be seen directly, hence the term dark.
	•	Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs):  One popular dark‑matter candidate is a WIMP.  WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are much heavier than protons but interact only through gravity and the weak nuclear force ￼.  They have no electromagnetic charge and therefore do not couple to EM fields.  Experiments look for rare nuclear recoils when WIMPs scatter off atomic nuclei (direct detection) or look for gamma‑ray photons produced when WIMPs annihilate (indirect detection) ￼.

Models with extremely weak EM couplings

Although most dark‑matter candidates are electromagnetically neutral, some theoretical models predict extremely weak couplings to electromagnetic fields.  Two important examples are axions and hidden photons.

Axion dark matter
	•	Axion hypothesis:  Axions were proposed in the late 1970s to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics.  NASA describes axions as hypothetical low‑mass particles that might make up dark matter ￼.  They are electrically neutral but can couple weakly to EM fields through an axion–photon interaction.
	•	Axion–photon coupling:  In the presence of a strong magnetic field, an axion field can convert into real photons.  A review in Science Advances explains that emergent electromagnetic radiation (photons) in a magnetic field can be a distinctive signature of axion dark matter ￼.  This happens because a classical magnetic field provides virtual photons with which axions can interact, leading to the conversion of axions into photons ￼.  The axion field modifies Maxwell’s equations, inducing effective electric and magnetic currents proportional to the axion–photon coupling constant ￼.
	•	Detection strategies:  Experiments use resonant cavities immersed in superconducting magnets to convert axions into microwave photons.  The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) at the University of Washington threads a tunable microwave cavity with a strong magnetic field; halo axions would convert into microwave photons and be detected with quantum‑limited receivers ￼.  Helioscope experiments like CAST at CERN aim to detect axions produced in the Sun by converting them back to photons ￼.  Light‑shining‑through‑a‑wall experiments such as ALPS use strong lasers and magnets to convert photons into axions and then back into photons behind an optical barrier ￼.

Hidden‑photon dark matter
	•	Kinetic mixing:  Some models propose a new U(1) gauge boson (a “dark photon”) that kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon.  If dark matter consists of such hidden‑sector photons, they would carry a tiny oscillating electric field.  The FUNK experiment at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology notes that when hidden photons interact with a conducting surface, this oscillating electric field can induce the emission of photons whose frequency matches the hidden‑photon mass ￼.  A large spherical metallic mirror is used to focus these photons and search for hidden‑photon dark matter in the eV and sub‑eV mass range ￼.
	•	Dish‑antenna method:  In the dish‑antenna approach, dark‑matter hidden photons mixing with regular photons produce faint electromagnetic waves at the surface of a conductor.  The FUNK mirror focuses this emission into a detector.  The experiment explains that dark‑matter hidden photons accompanied by a tiny oscillating electric component can be converted into photons at the surface of a metal mirror, and these photons are collected at the centre of the mirror ￼.

Summary: electromagnetic couplings

Dark matter is “dark” because its particles do not interact with the electromagnetic force and thus do not emit or absorb light ￼ ￼.  WIMPs, the traditional dark‑matter candidate, are neutral and interact only via gravity and the weak force ￼.  However, alternative candidates such as axions and hidden photons have extremely weak couplings to electromagnetic fields.  Axions can convert into photons in strong magnetic fields ￼, and hidden photons can convert at conducting surfaces ￼.  These couplings enable sensitive experiments—haloscopes, helioscopes and dish‑antenna detectors—that search for dark matter using electromagnetic fields.

Dark matter and the Schwarzschild radius

The Schwarzschild radius

The Schwarzschild radius (also called the gravitational radius) is the radius below which the gravitational attraction of a mass causes it to undergo irreversible collapse.  Britannica defines it as the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light; its formula is \(R\g = 2GM/c^2\), where M is the mass, G the gravitational constant and c the speed of light ￼.  For the Sun (M\approx1\,\mathrm{M{\odot}}), R\_g\approx3 km ￼.  A non‑rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole has an event horizon at this radius.

Dark‑matter distribution around black holes

Density spikes
When a massive black hole grows in a dark‑matter halo, the surrounding dark matter is drawn inward.  A general‑relativistic analysis shows that as the black hole is grown adiabatically, dark matter forms a density spike near the event horizon.  The study by Sadeghian, Ferrer and Will (2013) calculated the dark‑matter distribution using the exact Schwarzschild geometry and found that the density of dark matter vanishes at a radius r = 2R\_S (twice the Schwarzschild radius) and not at 4R\_S as previously estimated ￼.  The analysis also showed that the spike very close to the black hole reaches much higher densities ￼.  This high‑density region enhances annihilation or decay signals and could affect stellar orbits.

Further studies incorporate these spikes into the modelling of gravitational waves.  A 2025 analysis described in ScienceDaily developed a fully relativistic model for extreme mass‑ratio inspirals (EMRIs)—systems where a small compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole.  The model shows that dense dark‑matter “spikes” around a black hole leave detectable fingerprints in gravitational‑wave signals ￼.  Upcoming detectors such as the ESA’s LISA mission could use these signatures to map dark‑matter distributions near black holes ￼.

Influence on the event horizon and black‑hole shadow
The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole depends only on the mass contained inside the event horizon.  Dark‑matter particles orbiting outside this radius do not change the Schwarzschild radius, but if dark matter is accreted into the black hole it increases the mass and hence the radius slightly.  In practice, dark‑matter densities near black holes are low compared with the black‑hole mass, so the effect on the event horizon is negligible.  However, in modified metrics where the black hole is embedded in a dark‑matter halo, theoretical analyses show that the size and brightness profile of a black‑hole shadow can change.  For example, solutions of a Schwarzschild‑like black hole immersed in a Dehnen‑type dark‑matter halo predict that the halo parameters can widen or shrink the shadow slightly, and high‑frequency quasiperiodic oscillations in accretion disks can probe these deviations ￼.  Future observations by the Event Horizon Telescope and gravitational‑wave detectors may place limits on dark‑matter density profiles.

Contribution of dark matter to black‑hole growth

Dark matter can be accreted by black holes, especially in the early Universe or in regions with high dark‑matter density.  Some models propose that primordial black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang could themselves make up a component of dark matter ￼.  Conversely, dark‑matter annihilation near black holes or coupling to radiation fields could influence accretion.  Nonetheless, simulations suggest that typical dark‑matter halo densities provide only a small fraction of the mass of supermassive black holes.  For instance, N‑body simulations indicate that dark matter contributes at most a few per cent to the mass of black holes at galaxy centres; the bulk of the mass comes from baryonic accretion and mergers.  As a result, the Schwarzschild radius largely reflects the mass of baryonic matter and the collapsed core rather than the dark‑matter halo.

Summary: dark matter and the Schwarzschild radius
	1.	Definition of the Schwarzschild radius: The radius where escape velocity equals the speed of light; for mass M, R\_g=2GM/c^2.  It marks the event horizon of a non‑rotating black hole ￼.
	2.	Dark‑matter spikes: When a black hole is surrounded by a dark‑matter halo, the adiabatic growth of the black hole creates a density spike that vanishes at 2R\_S and reaches high densities near the event horizon ￼.
	3.	Effects on observables: Dark‑matter spikes can imprint signatures on gravitational waves from EMRIs ￼ and may slightly modify black‑hole shadows.  These effects offer potential probes of dark‑matter halos around black holes.
	4.	Negligible change to the Schwarzschild radius: The Schwarzschild radius depends on the mass inside the horizon.  Dark matter outside does not change the radius, and accreted dark matter is usually only a small fraction of the black‑hole mass, so the classical Schwarzschild radius remains essentially unchanged.

Conclusion

Dark matter is a key component of the universe that interacts gravitationally but does not interact with electromagnetic fields ￼.  This lack of coupling makes dark matter invisible to telescopes, requiring indirect detection through gravitational effects.  Theoretical candidates such as axions and hidden photons introduce minuscule couplings to electromagnetic fields; these allow haloscope, helioscope and dish‑antenna experiments to search for dark‑matter particles by converting them into photons in the presence of strong magnetic fields or conductive surfaces ￼ ￼.  Such experiments complement direct and indirect searches for WIMPs.

The Schwarzschild radius defines the event horizon of a black hole; it depends only on the enclosed mass and is unaffected by dark matter outside the horizon ￼.  However, the gravitational attraction of a black hole can dramatically reshape the dark‑matter distribution, forming dense spikes that vanish at twice the Schwarzschild radius ￼.  These spikes have consequences for annihilation rates, gravitational‑wave signals and black‑hole shadows, offering novel ways to probe dark matter in extreme gravitational fields ￼.  Future observations by gravitational‑wave detectors and horizon‑scale imaging telescopes, combined with advances in axion and hidden‑photon searches, will help unravel the nature of dark matter and its subtle relationships with electromagnetic fields and black holes.
